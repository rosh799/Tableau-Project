HR Analytics Dashboard and Employee Trend Data Analysis

The Employee Data Analysis dashboard in Tableau visualizes workforce insights, including employee distribution by department, gender, education field, and job satisfaction levels. It also tracks degree types and travel frequency. The dashboard helps HR and management analyze workforce trends, improve job satisfaction, and optimize organizational strategies for better decision-making.
